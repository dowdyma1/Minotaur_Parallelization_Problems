### Which of these three strategies should the guests choose? Please discuss the advantages and disadvantages.
The third strategy is the best one for this use case because this allows the guest
standing in the line a guarantee that they will be able to enter the room when it is
their turn in line, and it guarentees that their turn to go into the room will eventually
come (as long as they stay standing in line, the party doesn't end, and the guest
in the room eventually leaves). 
This also allows guests to avoid the confusion of having a sign on the door
as an indicator, because it is possible for two guests to see the AVAILABLE 
sign at the same time and try to enter at the same time.
